This app is intended to visualize data from the iOS App called Health Post.

In order to setup Health Post, you'll need the following information:

* A Running Splunk instance
* An HTTP Event Collector Input and Token
* The URL For your HTTP Event Collector Input
  * One other key point to note is that when you configure this app - please use the HTTP Event Collector endpoint URL that ends in /services/collector/event. This is important for the sake of making this app work. 

Once this app is setup, you should see data coming into your Splunk instance and this app's main dashboard should start to visualize the data.
